Prescriptive Analysis vs Predictive Analysis
- Prescriptive analytics tools like mathematical optimization help you make decisions based on your real-world business goals (“objectives”) and limitations (“constraints.”) This can be especially useful when you’re facing a business problem with multiple, conflicting goals (such as cutting spending while increasing production) and multiple constraints (such as time, distance, product availability).
